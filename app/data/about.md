#### Intro
Hi! Thank you for visiting my site!
<br>
I am a software developer focused in design and UI. I am available to consult on projects and am particularly interested in social impact, education, and inclusively. I enjoy advising companies and may even be available for pro-bono work depending on the time commitment and the project. If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in New Orleans.
<br><br>
#### Currently Seeking
In previous roles I have learned how to build teams and manage people, build relationships with customers, and sell enterprise products. Now I am looking to fully focus on building innovative and sustainable software.
<br><br>
#### Some History
I've lived in New Orleans for my entire life, only leaving for college from 2012 - 2016. My passion for software grew after building a software company in an Entrepreneurship course. I began teach myself how to code, working in technology companies, and I eventually took the dive to pursue software development full time.
